# mayaLiquify - A Maya Texturing Plugin
Before there was Mari (a long long time ago), 3d paint projection as a texturing tool was non-existent...so I made one.

This project is comically obsolete. If it was a phone, it would come with a nasal operator wearing horn rimmed glasses. If it was a car horn, it would make an "AHOOOOGAH!!!" sound. If it was a plane, it would have Orville Wright's terrified butt print on it.

And yet, I still hold a deep appreciation for what it achieved at the time. It still works by the way. I had to correct some errors and recompile the shader code - but it works ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
